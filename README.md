This program checks the strength of a user provided password and gives feedback in the form of improvements that could be made to make the password stronger.

In order to run this program, you will need to have Python installed. There are no necessary dependencies.

This tool is for educational use only and should not be used with any secure/sensitive information, such as real passwords. 

It is possible that this code could be modified by someone else for the malicious intent of stealing real passwords, so please never type in a real password.
In order to keep your real passwords safe and secure, consider using a password manager and never use the same password for multiple websites.
